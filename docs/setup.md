## Cursor Rules

The `.cursor/rules` file contains coding guidelines and examples that help maintain consistency across your project. This file is automatically read by Cursor IDE to provide context-aware suggestions.

### How to Use

1. Create a `.cursor/rules` file in your project root
2. Add coding standards, patterns, and examples relevant to your project
3. Include language-specific guidelines and preferred libraries
4. Cursor will use these rules to generate code that follows your project's conventions

### What to Include

- Code style preferences
- Naming conventions
- Component patterns
- Library usage examples
- TypeScript/JavaScript standards
- Framework-specific guidelines

The rules file acts as a reference for both developers and AI assistants to maintain code consistency throughout your project.
